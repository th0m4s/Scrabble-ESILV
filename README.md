End of semester project for the `Algorithm and OOP` module in the 1st semester of 2nd year at ESILV.

To play the game, simply compile the program. It will first ask you to copy the files from the `runtime` directory to the output directory `bin\Debug\net5.0`,
or you can also download the compiled version in the *releases* panel.
